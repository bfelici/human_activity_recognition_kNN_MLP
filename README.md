# Human Activity Recognition with k-Nearest Neighbors and Artificial Neural Networks
This repository contains the code written for the project of the course "Data Mining".
The dataset employed for this project is the HAR70+, which can be downloaded here https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/780/har70.
To reproduce the results, there are separate notebooks: 
- exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb, containing exploratory data analysis results
- knn_no_feature_engineering.ipynb, used to train the kNN classifier on the original dataset
- knn_feature_engineering.ipynb, used to train the kNN classifier on the dataset obtained with feature engineering
- nn_feature_engineering.ipynb, used to train the multilayer perceptron on the feature engineered data
- evaluation.ipynb, used to assess the statistical significance of the results
