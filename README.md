# Human Activity Recognition with k-Nearest Neighbors and Artificial Neural Networks
This repository contains the code written for the project of the course "Data Mining".
The dataset employed for this project is the HAR70+, which can be downloaded here https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/780/har70.
To reproduce the results, there are separate notebooks: one contains the exploratory data analysis, three are used to train the classifiers, and one is employed for evaluation.
